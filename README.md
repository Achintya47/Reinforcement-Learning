# Reinforcement Learning Projects

This folder contains my personal implementations and explorations in the field of **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** â€” a domain Iâ€™m deeply passionate about. I'm working through core algorithms from scratch to gain a **deeper, intuitive understanding** of the mechanics behind modern RL techniques.

Rather than relying solely on pre-built libraries, Iâ€™m building everything from the ground up to **internalize the fundamentals**, debug my thought process, and prepare myself for research-level projects in the future.

### ðŸ”¸ `Actor_Critic_Policy_from_scratch/`

An implementation of the **Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C)** algorithm using PyTorch.  
This folder contains:

- A modular A2C class using `nn.Sequential`
- Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)
- Entropy regularization
- A complete training notebook for LunarLander-v2
- A manual gameplay script to understand the environment better

> This project was a huge learning milestone and boosted my confidence in applying policy gradient methods from the ground up.

Stay tuned â€” upcoming subfolders will include implementations of **PPO**, **DQN**, and other RL algorithms, all developed from scratch with minimal abstractions.
